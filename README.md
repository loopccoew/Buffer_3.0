Using Djikstra's Algorithm and Graph Data Structure, we have computed the shortest path between cities.
1. We have Considered 5 cities (Mumbai, Assam, Bhubaneswar, Banglore, Delhi) and hardcoded the distances between them.
2. Graph of the 5 cities is shown using Adjacency Matrix of distances of the cities
3. Djikstra's Algorithm is used to compute the shortest path
4. We have offered 3 modes of Transport - Bus, Train and aeroplane, user can choose their prefered mode.
5. Services such AC/Non-AC is provided. 
6. Customer can also opt for meals during their ride.
7. The total time and cost for the entire journey for 1 person is also computed and shown.
8. The total bill is all inclusive (Meal, Ac/Non-Ac, Ticket cost) for entered number of people.
