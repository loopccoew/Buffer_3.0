**Introduction: -**  

Hello, we’re Team Dead Souls. This is a project to help navigate through our college and find the shortest routes between two places.
This is what our interface looks like: -

**Why do we need a navigation system for Cummins?**  

It’s difficult to find classrooms and labs when you first enter our campus as a student or a guest. We also realized that we normally use a longer route to reach some places where we could have used a shorter alternative if we had already known about its existence. This project helped us find some very interesting paths to take and now it’ll help you too.

**Instructions: -**  

* Path for java code: Buffer_3.0/app/src/main/java/com/example/cumminsnavigator/
* The code is split into 3 java files. The ‘node’ file is used to store the buildings as vertices and creates a double dimensional arraylist of the rooms in that building, floor-wise.
* Class ‘map’ stores the main dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest distance and path.
* Class ‘MakeMap’ is used to create and store the graph.
* Frontend is created using Android Studio.
* Download the code as a zip file, extract the files, and you will be able to open it in your android studio software. 
* You can see the working of our app on an emulator.
* Do not set the phone on dark mode.
* You can also install our app by downloading the CumminsNavigator.apk file.
